##Some thoughts
I am more of a coder interested in data, algorithms, architecture and tooling then in design.
Therefore I will style only as much as I need and overengineer on the architecture and tooling part.

I aim for a modular code structure based on RequireJS, because of an aversion against big code-files.
Hopefully the code is mostly self-explanatory through good naming and structure.
Comments will be where my future self might have problems in understanding.
